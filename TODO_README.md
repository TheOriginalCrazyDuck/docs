## List of pages/section that need to be migrated from the A32NX docs or completed in general
Changes have been made to this list to better reflect meeting alignment with core team and A380 team. The lists below are "MUST HAVES" before we move forward with a release pipeline (at least on the docs side of things). It will be structured as follows:

- P1 - High Priority (for RC and general public)
  - Requires assistance from dev, pilot insight, and general collaboration to get out the door.
- P2 - Ongoing work
  - As aircraft develops this can be done in tandem or shortly after RC and general release.
- Docs Team - Manadatory for docs team to complete before RC and general release.
  - Clean up and docs structure that will be handled by Docs Maintainers. Contributors can focus on content.

Let's try and avoid duplication where possible.
