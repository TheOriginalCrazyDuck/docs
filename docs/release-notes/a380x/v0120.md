# A380X Alpha - Release v0.12.0

![a380x-release-card-v1.png](../assets/a380x-release-card-v1.png)

We are very excited to finally provided our users with our open alpha stage developer preview of the A380X. We have taken steps to ensure at minimum that the aircraft is
capable of an A to B flight on VATSIM.

These release notes are meant to provide an initial outlook into the features available for our very first release of this aircraft.

## Release Feature List
